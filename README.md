#  CardioGuard – Heart Disease Prediction Model

CardioGuard is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts the risk of heart disease using user-provided health inputs. It was developed as a final-year BSc IT project and uses Flask for the web interface and a trained Random Forest model for prediction.

##  Features

- User registration and login system (secure with password hashing)  
- Input form for medical data like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.  
- Real-time heart disease prediction using a trained ML model  
- Clean and responsive user interface  
- Error handling for invalid inputs  
- Option to track prediction history (if implemented)
